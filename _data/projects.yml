  description: NYTLT is a platform designed to simulate various production traffic scenarios within the New York Times. Backed by Kubernetes and Graphana's k6, NYTLT is capable of generating more than 1 million requests per second on demand. The architecture spins from zero and is capable of scaling up to maximum capacity within 5 minutes. Tests are self service; written, launched, and managed by developers themselves. Several libraries are written and maintained by the Reliability Engineering team to assist with Authentication, Storage, Access, Observability, and Compute needed to run tests to completion.
